    <h1><strong>Automotive Hobby</strong></h1>
    <p class="subH1">Between weightlifting and cars, it is a very difficult choice when asked what my favorite hobby is. Modifying japanese cars and taking them to meets and shows has been a staple in my life, ever since adolescence. Building a few project cars over the years, I have learned several things.</p>

    <div class="fundamentals">
        <h3>Three fundamentals learned through building project cars.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Attention to detail</strong></li>
            <p>Basically anyone can buy a set of wheels and coilovers and call it a "build". It's the minor details that really showcase a build and the passion within the individual who built it.</p>
            
            <li><strong>Patience and Planning is required</strong></li>
            <p>Often times you may run into logistical issues, scheduling issues, and unforeseen problems with parts that you were unaware of before starting the build. Proper planning and having the patience to tackle some of these issues are key when building show quality vehicles.</p>
            
            <li><strong>Perfection is almost impossible</strong></li>
            <p>One common problem I face is getting over the fact that no matter how much time or money I pour into my project, it will never be "Perfect". At the end of the day, these vehicles have been used for their intended purposes, and for example, my Lexus IS300 is now a 24 year old vehicle. Learn to love the oddities or imperfections in your build, but don't twist this mindset into allowing yourself to "cut corners".</p>
